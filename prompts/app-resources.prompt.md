Generate a Kubernetes Deployment manifest that demonstrates proper resource requests and limits.

Requirements:
- Use apiVersion apps/v1
- Kind: Deployment
- Application name: my-app
- Single container using image my-app:1.0.0
- Expose container port 8080
- Define CPU and memory resource requests and limits
- CPU request: 100m, CPU limit: 200m
- Memory request: 100Mi, memory limit: 200Mi
- Use consistent labels and selectors
- Keep the manifest minimal and production-ready

The output should focus on resource management best practices.
